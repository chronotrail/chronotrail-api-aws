# Requirements Document

## Introduction

ChronoTrail is a REST API service that enables users to store and query their personal timeline data through natural language. The service accepts various types of user data including location visits, text notes, photos, and voice recordings, processes them using AI capabilities, and stores them in a vector database for intelligent retrieval. Users can ask natural language questions about their stored data and receive contextual answers with optional media attachments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile app user, I want to submit location visit data to the API, so that I can track where I've been and when.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to the location visits endpoint with user_id, coordinates (lon, lat), address, name(s), visit time, duration, and optional description THEN the system SHALL validate the data format and store structured data in relational database and description in vector database
2. WHEN location data is missing required fields THEN the system SHALL return a 400 error with specific field validation messages
3. WHEN location data is successfully stored THEN the system SHALL return a 201 status with a confirmation response including the location visit ID

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a mobile app user, I want to submit text notes to the API, so that I can store my thoughts and observations with optional location context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to the text notes endpoint with user_id, text_notes, timestamp, and optional location data THEN the system SHALL store the text in the vector database with proper embeddings
2. WHEN text notes exceed reasonable length limits THEN the system SHALL return a 400 error with size constraints
3. WHEN text notes are successfully processed THEN the system SHALL return a 201 status with storage confirmation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a mobile app user, I want to upload photos to the API, so that visual information from my timeline can be analyzed and made searchable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to the photos endpoint with user_id, image file, and timestamp THEN the system SHALL analyze the image for text content using OCR
2. WHEN a photo contains readable text THEN the system SHALL extract and store the text in the vector database
3. WHEN a photo contains no readable text THEN the system SHALL generate a descriptive caption and store it in the vector database
4. WHEN photo file format is unsupported THEN the system SHALL return a 400 error with supported format information
5. WHEN photo processing is complete THEN the system SHALL return a 201 status and store the original file for potential retrieval

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a mobile app user, I want to upload voice recordings to the API, so that my spoken notes can be transcribed and made searchable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to the voice notes endpoint with user_id, audio file, and timestamp THEN the system SHALL transcribe the audio to text
2. WHEN transcription is successful THEN the system SHALL store the transcribed text in the vector database with embeddings
3. WHEN audio file format is unsupported THEN the system SHALL return a 400 error with supported format information
4. WHEN voice processing is complete THEN the system SHALL return a 201 status and store the original file for potential retrieval

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a mobile app user, I want to ask natural language questions about my stored data, so that I can easily retrieve specific information from my timeline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to the query endpoint with user_id and natural language question THEN the system SHALL search the vector database for relevant matches
2. WHEN relevant data is found THEN the system SHALL return a natural language response with the requested information
3. WHEN no relevant data is found THEN the system SHALL return a response indicating no matching information was found
4. WHEN the query is ambiguous THEN the system SHALL return clarifying questions or the best available matches

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a mobile app user, I want to retrieve original photos or voice recordings referenced in query responses, so that I can access the full context of my stored information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a query response references a photo or voice recording THEN the system SHALL include media identifiers in the response
2. WHEN a GET request is made to retrieve specific media with valid media_id THEN the system SHALL return the original file
3. WHEN a media file is requested by an unauthorized user THEN the system SHALL return a 403 error
4. WHEN a requested media file doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL return a 404 error

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the API to handle user authentication and data isolation, so that users can only access their own data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API request is made THEN the system SHALL validate user authentication
2. WHEN a user attempts to access another user's data THEN the system SHALL return a 403 error
3. WHEN authentication is invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL return a 401 error
4. WHEN data is stored or retrieved THEN the system SHALL ensure proper user_id isolation

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a mobile app user, I want to query and retrieve my location visits by time period, so that I can review and manage my location history.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GET request is made to retrieve location visits with date range parameters THEN the system SHALL return a list of location visits within the specified timeframe
2. WHEN location visits are returned THEN the system SHALL include all structured data (coordinates, address, name, visit time, duration) and current description
3. WHEN no location visits exist for the specified timeframe THEN the system SHALL return an empty list with 200 status
4. WHEN date range parameters are invalid THEN the system SHALL return a 400 error with format requirements

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a mobile app user, I want to update location visit information including descriptions, so that I can add context and correct details after the initial visit recording.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a PUT request is made to update a location visit with visit_id and updated fields THEN the system SHALL validate the user owns the location visit and update the specified fields
2. WHEN description field is updated THEN the system SHALL update both the relational database record and the vector database embeddings
3. WHEN attempting to update a non-existent location visit THEN the system SHALL return a 404 error
4. WHEN attempting to update another user's location visit THEN the system SHALL return a 403 error
5. WHEN location visit is successfully updated THEN the system SHALL return a 200 status with the updated record

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the API to provide proper error handling and logging, so that issues can be diagnosed and resolved efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any error occurs THEN the system SHALL log the error with appropriate detail level
2. WHEN client errors occur THEN the system SHALL return structured error responses with helpful messages
3. WHEN server errors occur THEN the system SHALL return generic error messages while logging detailed information
4. WHEN file processing fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error information about the failure reason
